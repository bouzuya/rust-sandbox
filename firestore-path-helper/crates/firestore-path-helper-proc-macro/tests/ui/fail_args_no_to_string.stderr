   = note: the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
           `RepoId: std::fmt::Display`
           which is required by `RepoId: ToString`
   = note: in format strings you may be able to use `{:?}` (or {:#?} for pretty-print) instead
note: the trait `std::fmt::Display` must be implemented

   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
   = note: the following trait defines an item `to_string`, perhaps you need to implement it:
           candidate #1: `ToString`
   = note: this error originates in the macro `firestore_path_helper_proc_macro::firestore_path_helper` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
